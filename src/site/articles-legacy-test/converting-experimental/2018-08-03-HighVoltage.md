# Danger: High Voltage {.title}

More than half the cards in this tournament winning deck piloted by Mouche are Power sources. "*[I heard Alessi is still free to grow][]*" raises the question: When is too much Power just enough?

## Power to those who seek it

**Eternal** card game requires a minimum of 25 **Power Cards** in order for your deck to be valid. Decks that may be especially **Power**-hungry will commonly include a few extras, sometimes [up to a total of 28][Portrait]. Maybe [30][Camat0's Hot Rod] if you really want to push it.

But at the [Eternal Tournament Series][] recent [S3W3][] event, Mouche took first-place piloting a deck that includes *no less than 32* **Power Cards**.

Overall there is a grand total of 39 **Power** sources when you include **Find the Way** and **Auralian Merchant**.

That means *over half* of the cards in this Van de Graaf generator of a deck are **Power** sources. For most lists, that would be a recipe for a disastrous flood.

But as the first-place finish demonstrates, it somehow works in this case.
{.tagline}

## The first step: Innovation

With all that **Power** you might expect to see some high-cost finishers such **Sword of the Sky King** or maybe even a **Novaquake Titan**.

But nope, the curve for Mouche's deck tops out at four. Hmm...okay. Maybe the deck has a lot of high **Influence** requirements then?

That's not it either. None of the cards require triple **Influence**. And the steepest **Influence** cost to play any card in the entire deck is {% icon 'TTJJ' %} for **Sword of Unity**.

If not greedy **Power** costs or **Influence** requirements then, what is all that **Power** for exactly?

After a closer look, it becomes clear that there are a specific combination of reasons why an overload of **Power** works for this deck in particular. 

## Take this

On the most obvious level, **Power** does here what you might expect it to by ensuring that impacful 1- and 2-drops can be played on time. Although **Teacher of Humility**, **Awakened Student** and **Alessi, Combrei Archmage** are all low-cost units in terms of **Power**, they each have **Influence** requirements that are a little trickier.

Unlike an **Aggro** deck that plays low-cost single **Influence** units such as **Oni Ronin** or **Crownwatch Paladin**, Mouche's deck needs to work a bit harder to meet {% icon 'TJ' %} or {% icon 'TT' %} in the early stages.

The pay-off is that each of these units might quickly run away with a game. Any one of them can lead to a strong start. And a quick glance at the **Power Odds** table shows that Mouche has a very favorable chance of being able to play all of them on curve.

## Mind over body

Speaking of **Awakened Student**, the 2-cost **Combrei** mystic can be very useful when it comes to converting your **Power** into a bigger board presence. The mechanic is called **Empower** for a reason.

With one or more of these guys in play, your **Power** cards essentially become *zero*-cost spells that might as well read "Give your **Awakened Students** +1/+1."

It is also worth mentioning that (in addition to being a fifth pull for **Crownwatch Press-gang**), **Wandering Wisp** can become a very powerful threat that quickly snowballs after {% icon 'TTTTT' %}. This helps to explain why the deck includes a shocking ten **Time Sigils**.

## Standard tactics

Perhaps most importantly of all however, the **Power** base for this list takes full advantage of a new type **Power** card that was introduced with the **Fall of Argenport**. 

In the early game, **Temple Standard** and **Crownwatch Standard** both provide you with **Depleted** power when you need it. 

However - once you reach a **Maximum Power** of five - these sources conveniently **Transmute** into efficient, low-cost spells: the **Tactics**.

![Influence Chart](/images/articles/AlessiStandardTactics.jpeg "Alessi influence chart 3")
{.main-col-image}

Mouche calitalizes on the potential of these new cards by including a full contingent: all eight of the **Standards** that are available to **Combrei** can be found in this list.

## Finding a way

**Crownwatch Tactic** and **Temple Tactic** are useful on their own. But they are even more valuable when they become fuel for **Alessi**, who grows with each spell played.

So much so that the pilot of this deck will often want to hold on to the **Standards** and play **Undepleted** power sources instead, even if it means leaving one **Power** on the table at the end of their turn. It is one of the most important reasons why this deck manages to avoid flooding.

In a similiar fashion, **Find the Way** serves as both a power source and a buff to **Alessi** and **Awakened Student**. It's always nice to draw an extra **Power** and get an extra card thanks to **Echo**. But when those cards are also spells that grow your units, you are getting twice the value.

## Free to grow

When you take into consideration that 11 of the 39 **Power** sources in this deck also double as low-cost fuel for growing your board, all that extra **Power** starts to seem much more reasonable.

The most successful deck-builders are those who find ways to make the abilities of their cards work in more ways than one. **"*I heard Alessi is still free to grow*"** demonstrates that this can be just as true for your **Power **base as it is for your units, spells, weapons, relics and curses.

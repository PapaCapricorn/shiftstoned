# QUADRAGRAPHIC: Four decks, four Power bases, one winner  {.title}

**camat0** sits down with **Shiftstoned** to discuss the **Power bases** behind all four of his winning lists from the [Eternal Community League's][] inaugural [Sunday Challenge][] event. We talk **Power**, **Crests**, fixing and the merits of **Privilege of Rank**.

**camat0** is a name familiar to anyone who follows competitive **Eternal**. The current reigning [Eternal Tournament Series][] **World Champion** and **2018 All-Star** is showing no signs of slowing down this year.

## Part I - The New Icaria Black

![Decklist](/images/articles/IblackDecklist.jpeg "Icaria Black decklist")
{.side-image}

**camat0's** *Removal Pile*, updated for the **Fall of Argenport**. How has the **Power** base changed and what makes it even better now?
{.tagline}

![Influence chart](/images/articles/FJSControlChart.jpeg "Icaria Black influence chart")

**Shiftstoned:**\
You chose this list for one of your four decks this past Sunday as part of the event's Conquest format. But the origins of this deck stretch back a while…
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
This is the first deck I built with the **Fall of Argenport**. In fact I built this deck the day after **Fall of Argenport** was legal, and it has changed very little from there.

But this version of** FJS** is basically an updated version of *Removal Pile*, the deck I made to break the **Tavrod** meta back in early 2018.

At that time, manuS and I finished first and second in the **Eternal Tournament Series** [weekly swiss event][] with that version of the deck, the first tournament we ever played it.

{% card_image "Crest of Glory" %}

**Shiftstoned:**\
Since then, some things have changed in the way **Power** bases are built in **Eternal**. One of the major differences between this list and the previous versions appears to be the inclusion of all 12 available **Crests**.
{.highlight}

How do you think this has improved the deck?
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
**Crests** changed the game at a fundamental level. They not only made every **Control** and **Midrange** deck more consistent, but they also allow **Control** decks to play more **Power** without flooding out.

Now that we have all ten of the **Crests**, I think every **Control** deck that plays three colors should play at least one or two more **Power** cards than they used too. In the end, I find more **Power** makes your deck work better in every way now.

**Shiftstoned:**\
Right, the previous version included just the minimum of 25 **Power** cards, but now you have a total of 26 **Sigils**, **Crests** and **Waystones** here.
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
Yes. Also the existence of **Crests** makes it really hard to justify two color **Control** decks any more. You want the **Crest** even if they are off-color, and at that point splashing another color is just too easy.

**Shiftstoned:**\
It looks like you also added an extra copy of **Privilege of Rank**, another **Power** source…
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
Many people play **Privilege of Rank** only because it has synergy with **Bulletshaper** or other discard effects, when the truth is that the card is just good.

I'm happy to hard cast the card in a lot of decks, but most people don't and I think that is why it was so underplayed.
{.tagline}

## Part II - The Boogeyman

![Decklist](/images/articles/CallMeDecklist.jpeg "Call Me Maybe decklist")
{.side-image}

**camat0's** *Call Me Maybe* is a complicated list with a **Power** base that has seen much refinement since its early origins as a *Charge Rod* deck.
{.tagline}

![Influence chart](/images/articles/CallMeChart.jpeg "Call Me Maybe influence chart")
{.main-col-image}

\[**Edit:** As this article was being finalized, **Dire Wolf Digital** [announced][] that **Answer the Call** has been nerfed to **7{% icon 'JJ' %}**. While it remains to be seen what impact this will have on **Eternal**, the image above and conversations with camat0 have been preserved to reflect the state of the meta at the time of his first-place tournament finish with this deck.\]

  [announced]: https://steamcommunity.com/games/531640/announcements/detail/1692677521819338427

**Shiftstoned:**\
For a while now, **Divining Rod** has allowed players to cheat out units that their **Power** base wouldn't normally support by playing them automatically from the deck rather than from hand. But it has remained something of a fringe strategy. What changed?
{.highlight}

{% card_image "Answer the Call" %}

**camat0:**\
The key for *Charge Rod* was to stop playing the cards (like **Heart of the Vault** or **Alluring Ember**) that made the **Power** base so hard. This last version of the deck has a very good **Power** base, so hard casting your cards \[ie: playing them at full cost\] is not a problem at all if you can survive.

**Shiftstoned:**\
Still, the **Influence Chart** demonstrates that there is a lot of competition for hitting fairly demanding **Influence** requirements in the mid to late game. With only a moderate amount of additional card draw. What makes this possible?
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
I do believe one of the most important cards in the deck is again **Privilege of Rank** because the deck is so **Power** hungry, and basically can't win if you don't hit six **Power** on **Turn 6** \[for **Answer the Call**\].

And to play that card, it was necessary to make the deck almost exclusively **Rakano** ({% icon 'FJ' %}), and only splash the most necessary card from **Time** - **Divining Rod**.

I also play **Diogo Málaga** because it is not that hard to make it playable once we already play **Divining Rod** and he is very important for the early game of the deck.

**Granite Waystone** is also a particularly great **Power** card in this deck. It gives you you a free card to exchange in the **Market**, and also this little 1/1 transforms into a real threat when you play **Kaleb, Uncrowned Prince**.

**Shiftstoned:**\
The addition of **Answer the Call** has added weapons to the *Charge Rod* strategy of cheating out units, and pushed this deck into more mainstream success. Is it the 6{% icon 'JJ' %} spell \[now 7{% icon 'JJ' %}\] that holds it all together?
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
Yes, **Answer the Call** is the best card in the deck by a lot. You can win a game from an empty board with **Answer the Call**. Because you have like a 30% chance to hit **Divining Rod** and more than 75% to hit a **Charge** unit, so you make crazy stuff a lot of the time.

**Shiftstoned:**\
You wrote at length about your thoughts on *Charge Rod* as part of your [weekly metagame analysis][] on the **Eternal Titans** website. In addition to thanking your team mate Grimfan for his role in the deck's evolution, you spoke frankly about your feelings towards[so-called "unfair"][unfair] decks (ie: decks that win with explosive or high-rolling combos) in **Eternal**.
{.highlight}

  [weekly metagame analysis]: https://eternaltitans.com/camat0s-h0t-takes-7-31/
  [unfair]: https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/magic-general/515411-fair-unfair-decks

Do the cards exist now for more unfair decks that have yet to be discovered or refined? **Dramatist's Mask** for example…
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
I don't think **Dramatist's Mask** will see competitive play, because it is just to easy to interact with for the opponent.

But I do think the game is very friendly to unfair decks in general right now. **Markets** in particular made a lot of unfair decks possible with the consistency they add to the deck

## Part III - Even higher voltage

![Decklist](/images/articles/CombreiDecklist.jpeg "Combrei decklist")
{.side-image}

Shiftstoned recently featured an article on a [first-place tournament deck][HighVoltage] that included 39 Power Sources, which seemed pretty extreme at the time. Yet camat0's list contains no less than 41 **Power** Sources - well over half of the 75 cards in the deck. Are we seeing an escalating **Power** meta?
{.tagline}

  [HighVoltage]: /articles/HighVoltage.html

![Influence chart](/images/articles/CombreiChart.jpeg "Combrei influence chart")
{.main-col-image}

**Shiftstoned:**\
What makes **Power** so important in a deck that tops out at 4? (Or 6 if you include **Sword of Unity's Spellcraft**…)
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
Turns out that playing **Initiate of the Sands** into **Trail Maker** into 3 more units, and playing **Stand Together** or **Sword of Unity** before **Turn 5** beats most slow decks. It is just too much pressure and they can't even answer it with **Harsh Rule** \[because of all the units with **Aegis**\].

{% card_image "Sword of Unity" %}

This deck is all about curving out into **Stand Together** or **Sword of Unity**. Once you do that, they lose because they are too far behind in the board and can't play a board clear. So the **Power** is really important to make sure you can accomplish that.

**Shiftstoned:**\
This deck seems to play pretty fast. How would you characterize it? Is it? Midrange? Aggressive midrange? Something different?
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
I will say this is a **Midrange** deck, but most of the time it plays like a hyper aggressive deck. In this case I don't think the deck is great - really it is mediocre - but I made it to target slow decks, just to punish slow decks in the tournament.

And also you have the Plan B of using **Ironfist Chancellor** each turn if you stall. It is not that hard to protect him. And in particular if you ever play **Sword of Unity** on him, he becomes a nightmare for any deck.

**Shiftstoned:**\
Did you consider including any **Standards** for the synergy with **Alessi**?
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
I don't want **Standards** in this deck because it is all about curving out. The extra cards are way less important than having the board early and casting **Stand Together** on it.

## Part IV - Haters gonna hate

![Decklist](/images/articles/TJPDecklist.jpeg "TJP Hatebears decklist")
{.side-image}

camat0's *TJP Hatebears* is a three-color build that prioritizes **Time** and **Undepleted Power** for **Turn 2** **Teachers of Humility** ({% icon 'TT' %}) and **Turn 6 Predatory Carnosaurs** ({% icon 'TTT' %}), with a little **Svetya, Orene of Kosul** ({% icon 'JP' %}) in between.
{.tagline}

![Influence chart](/images/articles/TJPHatebearsChart.jpeg "TJP Hatebears influence chart")
{.main-col-image}

**Shiftstoned:**\
What were your thoughts when constructing the **Power** base for *TJP Hatebears*?
{.highlight}

**camato:**\
To make a power base that can support **Initiate of the Sands** on **Turn 1** and **Teacher of Humility** on Turn 2, I needed to make a sacrifice and and only splash the other colors.

As you can see I don't play \[higher Influence\] cards like **Valkyrie Enforcer** ({% icon 'JJ' %}) or **Hooru Pacifier** ({% icon 'JJP' %}). I would love to have them in the deck, but I just can't support them.

**Shiftstoned:**\
That brings up a great point that newer deck builders may be able to learn from. When building a three color **Power** base, you often want to prioritize cards in a certain color. So you are probably better off playing weaker cards (with lower **Influence** costs) in the secondary colors.
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
For sure. In general I say that people play less **Power** or fixing \[ie: **Influence** sources for secondary colors\] than they should.

**Shiftstoned:**\
Although you have one **Crystallize** in the Market, every other card in this deck is either **Time** or only has a single influence in any one color (including {% icon 'JP' %} and {% icon 'TJ' %}).
{.highlight}

This allows you to hit your priority **Influence** requirements quite reliably. And all this is accomplished without any additional card draw beyond **Seek Power**.
{.highlight}

{% card_image "Diplomatic Seal" %}

**camat0:**\
The key in this **Power** base is **Diplomatic Seal**. It is this card that allows you to build three color **Power** bases for aggressive decks.

**Shiftstoned:**\
Right, because the **Undepleted Power** lets you play your one and two-cost units early. It is also worth mentioning that you have a lot more potential for **Undepleted Power**, in the form of **Seats** instead of **Crests**.
{.highlight}

So you are maximizing your chances of playing important units on curve at every stage of the game. It is a very different approach from the **FJS Control** deck we were looking at earlier.
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
Yes, as you say I only have 2 **Crests**, and the reason for that is to have most of my power **Undepleted**. With 2 **Crests** and 4 **Seek Power**, I will draw less than two of them in most of my hands - making the deck curve out most of the time.

**Shiftstoned:**\
What does the future hold for **TJP Hatebears**?
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
This is a very powerful deck and I think it is good, but it is not great. I'm not sure what is missing yet to make this deck great, but for sure I think it has a lot of potential.

**Shiftstoned:**\
We are all looking forward to seeing what you come up with next.

## Epilogue: By Law and Conquest

**Shiftstoned:**\
Before we finish, can you describe for the readers what you might have done differently this time to prepare for a competitive event using the Conquest format? Was there anything extra involved in preparing four decks?
{.highlight}

**camat0:**\
I'm not sure what is the best strategy for Conquest yet. I do think you can try to target the metagame like I did last week, with all decks that are strong vs **Control** and clunky decks in general. But I don't think that is the only way to do it or the best one.

On the other hand, I think you need to play strong decks. That doesn't mean they can't have weakness. But you can't play a lineup with four decks that lose to the same thing. Let's say your lineup is weak to **Stand Together** and your opponent has two decks with that card - then even with the ban you will end losing. Try to play decks that can beat anything a reasonable amount of the time.

**Shiftstoned:**\
Thanks for taking the time to chat camatO. You've given the readers a lot to think about.
{.highlight}

Congratulations on your first place finish in the debut of **Eternal Community League's Sunday Challenge**. Hope you will **Answer the Call** and return to **Shiftstoned** again next time we ask for an interview.

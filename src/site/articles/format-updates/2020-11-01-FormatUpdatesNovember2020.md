**{% date page.date %}** - Tomorrow the *Eternal* Celebration will be ending, and the *Empty Thone* throwback draft format is leaving with it. The *Argent Depths* draft format will return, but [some things will be different][Card List]{target="_blank}.

Along with reordering the drafted packs and updating the Draft Pack's card weightings, 56 cards will be added to the Draft Packs and the Expedition format, followed a few days later by the new bundle set [Bastion Rising][]{target="_blank}. This is the second mid-format update to the *Argent Depths* draft format, after the [previous one in mid-August][August2020].

Here are the changes to the format's Draft Packs, sorted into **Added** for additions to the Draft Packs and Expedition, and **Kept** for adjusted weightings *(weighting affects the rate a card appears in draft&mdash;for example, cards with a weight of 5x are five times more likely to appear in Draft Packs than cards with a weight of 1x at the same rarity)*. 

*Note that kept cards with unchanged weightings are not listed here.* The official list of current Draft Pack contents and Expedition-legal cards can always be found [on DWD's site][Card List]{target="_blank}.

**{% date page.date %}** - [*Empire of Glass*][EoG]{target="_blank} was released today, and Dire Wolf Digital has [redesigned][Card List]{target="_blank} the *Eternal* Draft Packs and Expedition to complement the new set. Our trusty Grenadin have processed the changes into this handy interactive gallery for you! Use the toggles below to switch format views, and to filter cards further.

 [Card List]: https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/draft-packs-card-list/

A few notes:

* The **Expedition** view **does not** include the following sets, which remain in the format in their entirety: *Argent Depths* (including its promos, from *Coslo, Friendly Scavenger* onward), *Awakening*, *Bastion Rising*, *Empire of Glass* (including its promos).  
It **does** include changes to *Echoes of Eternity*, other Draft Pack updates, pre-*Argent Depths* promos, and older small sets.
* The **Draft Packs** view **only shows Draft Pack changes**, between this new format and the earlier format's [November 2020 update][] (ignoring *Empire of Glass'* Draft Preview).  
It also displays card weightings *(the rate a card appears in draft&mdash;for example, cards with a 5x weighting are five times more likely to appear than cards with a 1x weighting at the same rarity)*.
* Switching to the Draft Packs view displays additional filter options: toggles for each weighting, and weighting changes for cards kept in the Draft Pack.

**{% date page.date %}** - Today, the *Empire of Glass* Draft Packs [are being updated][2/24 Update]{target="_blank} with new cards and weighting changes *(weighting affects the rate a card appears in draft&mdash;for example, cards with a weight of 5x are five times more likely to appear in Draft Packs than cards with a weight of 1x at the same rarity)*.

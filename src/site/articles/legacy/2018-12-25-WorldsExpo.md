## ETS 2018 World Championship Finishers

<div class="pre-headline first">1st place:</div>

### [Rakano Ramp][deck-1]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by Tobboo

  [deck-1]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EB4MEBIEE0HErfHEBvECEwDEEVDB9EEB3ECBmFEE2JEDoEDE2HEsfMCBBIB-DEEzHDDBEBrNEA4BCAABrfBBsfBBsfCBBCBE2H&t=%5BTobboo%5D%20Rakano%20Ramp

{% card_image "Bulletshaper", "ci-small" %}

The inclusion of **Granite Waystones** ended up paying off for **Tobboo**, as 1/1 **Grenadins** played a significant role against **Relic Weapon** based strategies in the finals. **Flame Blast** (2{% icon 'FFF' %}) probability seems deceptively low after two draws, but realistically this spell will not be played until much later.

A total of 38 **Justice** sources ensures that **Amili, Cloudmarshal** (5{% icon 'JJJ' %}) will reliably fly on time. And of course several cards help to put the &#8220;Ramp&#8221; into Rakano, including: **Icaria, Valkyrie Captain (2{% icon 'JJ' %}) **, **Yushkov the Usurper** (4{% icon 'FFF' %}) and **Bulletshaper** (2{% icon 'FJ' %}).

### [Worlds Deck FTJ Armory][deck-2]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by Erik9099

  [deck-2]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EB4MDBIDsfCEBsKEBvEEBtKEEVDB9EEBmFDCXCBgKEBsFEBiQCEqEBDpBBBpKCBBGB-DBB_BDEzHED7HDE3HCA4BEA2BCAABrfBBBIBsfCBCXBBgK&t=%5BErik9099%5D%20Worlds%20Deck%20FTJ%20Armory

{% card_image "Privilege of Rank", "ci-small" %}

Ten **Crests** allow **Erik9099** to **Scout** frequently for the cards they need, grabbing **Relic Weapons**, ramping up to **Icaria, the Liberator** (8{% icon 'FFFJJJ' %}) and (hopefully) bottoming the many **Firebombs** generated by one or more **Cauldron Cookbooks** (2{% icon 'FF' %}).

**Justice** is quite strongly prioritized over the other two **Factions**, enabling **Throne Warden** (5{% icon 'JJ' %}) and the deck's six sweepers, including a full set of **Harsh Rule (5{% icon 'JJ' %}).** and a pair of **End of the Story (6{% icon 'JJ' %}).**

**Time** is splashed for just two cards - **Desert Marhsal** (2{% icon 'TJ' %}) and **Combrei Healer** (3{% icon 'TJ' %}). Meanwhile **Privilege of Rank** (2{% icon 'J' %}) is so valuable, it is included even in the absence of any discard effects.

<div class="pre-headline third">3rd place:</div>

### [Cheesegrater 250][deck-3]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by Kangbreath

  [deck-3]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EB8HBB7HEEsGErfNDBvECEwDEAjBCCrHEE5GDCsHED6DEB3ECBmFEsfTEqfSGB-DGB5HECnHEDoICEhDEA3BCAABEnGBDiHBCsHBEgHBCyH&t=%5BKangbreath%5D%20Cheesegrater%20250

{% card_image "Crownwatch Tactic", "ci-small" %}

It never hurts to have a **Crownwatch Tactic** or two in hand, and **Kangbreath** can afford to include **Transmute** sources in a deck that tops out at five **Power** for **Tavrod, Auric Broker** (5{% icon 'JJSS' %}).

**Shadow** is slightly prioritized, making it easier to play an early **Devastating Setback** (3{% icon 'SS' %}) and ensuring that **Vara's Favor** (2{% icon 'S' %}) will reliably find a **Shadow Sigil** to draw.

### [Mystical Xenan][deck-4]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by SecondBlue

  [deck-4]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=CB6HCB8HDB4MCB7HECuGEAjBEEmCECsGCCvGDBiJEBjDEsfTCC_BDD3CEB0DDB2DFB5HEB_BEDzBEEqIEA9BECpGCAABBjCBCsBBCvGBD3CBB2D&t=%5BSecondBlue%5D%20Mystical%20Xenan

{% card_image "Waystone Infuser", "ci-small" %}

The abilities of **Worldbearer Behemoth** (5{% icon 'TTT' %}) and **Waystone Infuser** (5{% icon 'TT' %}) help to ensure that **Power** keeps flowing through **Mystic Ascendant** (6{% icon 'T' %}), the potent 6-drop that gives this deck its name.

In a two-faction **Time** deck there is very little downside to including a full set of **Amber Waystones**, as **SecondBlue** does here. **Shadow** sources are given a slight preference, most likely to increase the chances of holding {% icon 'SS' %} after three draws for **Ayan, the Abductor** (3{% icon 'TSS' %}).

### [8 Merchant Blitz][deck-5]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by Almost

  [deck-5]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBiEEBiIDEyECEvGEB4MEsfSCDvGEE5EDDwDEEuDEEpFEE3DEE-DEEgEDB-DEB7FCB5HCCnHDE9HBEhDEBpNEAzBCA3BCAABEyEBBhGBB2LBDwDBBnQ&t=%5BAlmost%5D%208%20Merchant%20Blitz﻿

{% card_image "Diplomatic Seal", "ci-small" %}

**Diplomatic Seals** can make it easier to play early units with demanding **Influence** requirements, especially in a three-faction list such as this one that ideally ideally wants to hit {% icon 'JJPPS' %} by **Turn 4**.

**Justice** is prioritized as the only **Faction** that requires double **Influence** from more than one card. A single **Crownwatch Standard** creates the potential for an additional **Combat Trick** to fuel **Almost's** twelve-plus **Units** that have pump spell synergy.

### [BBG SecondBlue's Combrei Mid][deck-6]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by childroland

  [deck-6]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBqCCEkDCB4MEBsKErfHEBvECEwDEEmCEB3EDBjDEEjEDE5HEBuFCB0DEsfMIB-DDB_BCDzBEBoNEE3HEA6BCAABBuKBE5HBByKBB0DBpfD&t=%5Bchildroland%5D%20BBG%20SecondBlue's%20Combrei%20Mid

{% card_image "Lingering Influence", "ci-small" %}

When you count **Power** draw spells and **Power** granting **Units**, this deck includes more sources than any other in the event. Eight **Justice Sigils** are waiting to be pulled by **Lingering Influence** (1{% icon 'J' %}) or the abilities of **Icaria, Vaklyrie Captain** (2{% icon 'JJ' %}) and **Telut, Queen's Hand** (7{% icon 'TT' %}). Meanwhile, **Marshal Ironthorn** (5{% icon 'JJ' %}) and **Mystic Ascendant** (6{% icon 'T' %}) allow **childroland** to get maximum value from all that **Power** being drawn.

### [ET Manu's FJS Zuberi][deck-7]{.epc-link target="_blank" name="fjs"} by Mouche

  [deck-7]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EB6HEB4MEsfSEBICBtIEpfPCBvEEEVECsHED-HEsfTDDzIDElBDE2HCBBDB-DDB5HDCnHDDsIEEzHCDoICDBEA8BCAABrfBBEhBBBjMBDzIBE2H&t=%5BMouche%5D%20ET%20Manu's%20FJS%20Zuberi

{% card_image "Crest of Chaos", "ci-small" %}

An **FJS** deck that omits **Icaria, the Liberator** (8{% icon 'FFFJJJ' %}) can go a little lighter on the **Justice** sources. This list prioritizes **Fire** and **Shadow** instead for midrange threats such as **Vicious Highwayman** (4{% icon 'FFSS' %}), **Zuberi Outlands Warrior** (4{% icon 'FF' %}) and **Vara Venegance-Seeker** (4{% icon 'SS' %}). Still, there is enough **Justice** **Influence** for **Mouche** to reliably play **Rizahn, Greatbow Master** (6{% icon 'FFJJ' %}) on curve.

### [I Couldn't Make Unitless Work So I'm Playing As Many Units As Possible][deck-8]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by TinMan

  [deck-8]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBFEBqCEBIEEjCEB2PEDhCBB9CEBdEEVCBhBDBoDEBnDDE2JBBwBDC3FCBBIB_BED7HEDBECrFEA2BCAABBhBBEhBBE2JBBwBBC1F&t=%5BTinMan%5D%20I%20Couldn't%20Make%20Unitless%20Work…

{% card_image "Trail Maker", "ci-small" %}

As the title implies, the strategy for this deck revolves around units. But that does not have to mean giving up on **Power** sources. A full play set of **Initiate of the Sands** (1{% icon 'T' %}) makes it easier to ramp up to **Assembly Line** (3{% icon 'FF' %}), or reach the **8 Power** necessary to gain maximum value from **Xenan Obelisk** (4{% icon 'T' %}).

**Trail Maker** (2{% icon 'T' %}) pulls triple duty as a **Unit**, a **Power** source *and* an **Influence** source. Meanwhile, a single **Amber Acolyte** does a convicing impersonation of **Seek Power** with a body. And **Yushkov the Usurper** (3{% icon 'FFF' %}) provides at least +1 Power for the turn after he comes down.

### [Blue Merchant Skycrag][deck-9]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by Paradox

  [deck-9]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EEFEBNDBhGEBQDsfBECpDEBIEC7FEE5EDBXCBUEEpFDBaEC_FHBBEB7FEBpNEA1BCEBEC6FCAABEyEBBhGBB9FBE4EBB5G&t=%5BParadox%5D%20Blue%20Merchant%20Skycrag

{% card_image "Shugo_Standard", "ci-small" %}

A deck with twelve 1-drops demands undepleted **Power** and versatile **Influence** from the opening hand, so a full set of **Diplomatic Seals** is a natural choice. **Shugo Standard** provides extra utility for **Paradox's** aggressive strategy, and is a safe bet in a deck that tops out at 3 **Power** (**Ultimates** and **Spellcraft** abilities notwithstanding). **Fire** is favored over **Primal**, and is the only faction in this deck to require more than a single **Influence** - for **Longbarrel** (1{% icon 'FF' %}), **Shogun's Scepter** (3{% icon 'FF' %}) and of course **Vadius, Clan Father** (3{% icon 'FFP' %}).

### [Chalice][deck-10]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by camat0

  [deck-10]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EB4MEBsKEC6GEDlFEBvEEEmCEBtKCB9EDBgDEB6GDBmFCBnLEC_GEBsFFB-DCB7FBB_BEE9HCE3HEDlIDAzBEA_BCAABD_BBBnLBDwCBE5HBByK&t=%5Bcamat0%5D%20Chalice

{% card_image "Auralian Merchant", "ci-small" %}

**Seek Power** and **Privilege of Rank** help to increase **camat0's** chances of reaching the **Influence** required for **Shelterwing Rider** (4{% icon 'JJPP' %}) after four draws. While it would seem this list also wants {% icon 'TT' %} on **Turn 4**, the only cards that actually have that **Influence** cost are specific answers in the **Market:** **Sword of Unity** (4{% icon 'TTJJ' %}) and **Lumen Reclaimer** (4{% icon 'TT' %}). Realistically these will be played much later in the game.

### [ETS World Championship Rakano][deck-11]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by ThePlatypusKing

  [deck-11]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBiEEBIEB6JEBrEBBUDBvECEwDEEVDD6DEB3EED-HDBmFEEjECB9JFBBHB-DEEzHDEhDEBrNEA4BCEBCAABBOBsfCBEhBBB9JBEB&t=%5BThePlatypusKing%5D%20ETS%20World%20Championship%20Rakano

{% card_image "Rakano Banner", "ci-small" %}

**Justice** gets priority over **Fire** for early **Units** such as **Valkyrie Enforcer** (2{% icon 'JJ' %}) and **Unseen Commando** (3{% icon 'JJ' %}). A single **Cauldron Cookbook** (2{% icon 'FF' %}) provides another example of how **Markets** allow players to include cards which their **Power** base might not otherwise support - **ThePlaytupusKing** has control over when he draws the powerful double-**Fire** **Relic**. And of course there is enough **Influence** to reliably play the mighty **Rakano Plate** (5{% icon 'FFJJ' %}) on time. A pair of **Shugo Standards** helps to punch through some additional **Overwhelm** damage.

### [Feln Mid][deck-12]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by TonyGeeeee

  [deck-12]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=DB6HDBhGEBtIDElIDrfNEDlFEAjBEEpFEB6GDB9LEBzLED7FEBhMGB7FEB5HCEhGED3EEDrIEBhNEA-BCAABBhGBElIBDnFBB5GBB_L&t=%5BTonyGeeeee%5D%C2%A0Feln%20Mid

{% card_image "Vara's Favor", "ci-small" %}

In a deck that wants to play a fully enabled **Champion of Cunning** (5{% icon 'PS' %}) early and often, an even split between **Primal** and **Shadow** sources makes sense (including **Vara's Favor** for 2{% icon 'S' %}). Four **Cobalt Waystones** protect against hand disruption and other face-targeting effects. **Wisdom of the Elders** and/or **Strategise** provide a couple of addional draws before **Turn 5**, helping **TonyGeeeee** reach the **Influence** requirements he needs for **Jotun Feast-Caller** (5{% icon 'PPP' %}) and enabling even more additional draws.

### [Get the Bridge][deck-13]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by SooNo

  [deck-13]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBqCEB4MEBrKBBsKEEjCEBvECEwDEEmCBBuKEB3EEBjDDE5HED3CDB0DDsfMHB-DDB_BEDzBEBoNEE3HEA6BCAABBuKBE5HBByKBB0DBpfD&t=%5BSooNo%5D%20Get%20the%20Bridge

{% card_image "Telut, Queen's Hand", "ci-small" %}

Twenty-six **Power** cards symmetrically divided between **Time** and **Justice** are bolstered by an additional 12 secondary sources in this high voltage **Combrei** deck. **Awakened Student** (2{% icon 'TJ' %}) derives extra value from **Power** cards played early in the game while **Mystic Ascendant** (6{% icon 'T' %}) does the same on later on. **Worldbearer Behemoth** (5{% icon 'TTT' %}) and **Telut, Queen's Hand** (7{% icon 'JJ' %}) provide assistance with their **Power** drawing abilities.

### [Maiden's Rest][deck-14]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by BruisedByGod

  [deck-14]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EB6HDB8HEBIEBtIEEsGErfNEAjBEqfNEEVEBiJDBjMEsfTEDrHDBBHB5HBEhGEDsIEA8BCEBEBjNCAABrfBBsfCBBjMBBwBBEB&t=%5BBruisedByGod%5D%20Maiden's%20Rest

{% card_image "Cabal Standard", "ci-small" %}

**Shadow** is highly prioritized over **Fire** in this **Stonescar** midrange list which aims to hit {% icon 'SSS' %} on **Turn 5** for **Shadowlands Tyrant**. **Fire** cards with more than a single {% icon 'F' %} are relegated to the market - where **BruisedByGod** can draw them once the required **Influence** has been met. A smattering of **Standards** create potential for surprising **Overwhelm** or **Quickdraw** attacks, pairing nicely with the deck's **Deadly** units.

### [ManuS Ambitious Kerendon Midrange][deck-15]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by lv13david

  [deck-15]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EB6HEB4MEsfSEBICBtIEpfPCBvEEEVECsHED-HEsfTCDzIEElBDE2HCBBDB-DDB5HDCnHDDsIEEzHCDoICDBEA8BCAABrfBBEhBBBjMBDzIBE2H&t=%5Blv13david%5D%20Manus%20Ambitious%20Kerendon%20Midrange

{% card_image "Seat of Chaos", "ci-small" %}

An [identical list](#fjs) to the one brought by **lv13david's** teammate **Mouche**, with a slightly different title. Both versions break the **Winchest (FJS)** mold by skipping **Icaria, the Liberator** for a mid-range package of **Units** that almost looks more like **Stonescar** than **Rakano**.

### [Teamrankstar.com Tokens][deck-16]{.epc-link target="_blank"} by Magikarp

  [deck-16]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBFEBqCEBIEEjCEB2PEDhCEBdEEVDBhBCEhBEBoDEBnDCBwBDC3FCBBHB_BED7HEDBECrFEA2BCAABCwFBBhBBEhBBBwBBEB&t=%5BMagikarp%5D%20Teamrankstar.com%20Tokens

{% card_image "Granite Waystone", "ci-small" %}

**Time** is slightly favored over **Fire** to prioritize early units such as **Initiate of the Sands** (1{% icon 'T' %}) and **Teacher of Humility** (2{% icon 'TT' %}). The potential for a 1-cost 5/5 **Grenadin** (with two activated **Xenan Obelisks** in play) mitigates any risk of a possibly depleted **Seat of Impulse** early on, so a full set of **Granite Waystones** are included.

As of this writing, **Eternal Card Games's** newest expansion [Defiance][] has only been out for a few days, but it already feels almost like an entirely different game. It will be interesting to take a look at next year's ETS winners and see how things compare with these portraits from the end of the Fall of Argenport meta.

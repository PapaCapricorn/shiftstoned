**{% date page.date %}** - With the conclusion of **Burning Hope** we are one step closer to the **2019 Eternal World Championship**, and two more players have earned an invitation to the main event. Congratulations to **DarkestHour** and **trumpets** for advancing to the next round, and to all those who qualified for the **ECQ**.

## The Top Eight

<span style="font-size: 1.7em;">J</span>ekk's 
<span style="font-size: 1.7em;">S</span>ake! Winchest reigns {.tagline}

**Fire** was featured in every one of the **Top Eight** decks from the competition, with **Winchest** {% icon 'FJS' %} composing more than half of lists in both the finals and the tournament overall. Yet each of the winners built their list somewhat differently.

All of the summaries here include a standout feature describing what sets each deck apart from the others. {.highlight}

<div class="pre-headline first">1st place:</div>

### [DarkestHour's Deck][deck-1]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Winchest Midrange)

  [deck-1]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=CA4BCA3BDA8BEB4MEBIDBvEEBjMDBBDB-DCB5HECsHEDsICDoIEEzHEE2HEFkBEFmGEFwGEFyGEFvHDpfPEsfTCAABBsFBB9JBF_CBFuDBF1G&t=DarkestHour's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Burning%20Hope%7D

{% card_image "Martyr's Chains", "ci-small" %}

The winning deck forgoes **Winchest Cargo** in favor of a full playset of **Seek Power**. While **DarkestHour** misses out on the opporunity for new cards created by **Winchest Contraband**, this means they can more reliably reach the **Power** and **Influence** requirements for both **Xo of the Endless Hoard** (7{% icon 'FFF' %}) and **Martyr's Chains**(9{% icon 'JJJJ' %}). More importantly perhaps, both **Seek Power** and **Lost Scroll** (2{% icon 'JS' %}) provide additional **Power** cards for the devastating **Empower** ability of **Martyr's Chains**. With **Chains** in play, **Seek Power** effectively becomes a 1-cost **Slay** as long as you have **Sigils** to draw.

<!-- 20F, 21J, 21S  A nearly even distribution of F, J and S sources with a total of ten **Crests**. 3x **Quarry** helps to build in some potential cost reducion in addition to card draw. -->

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} Does not include any cards that can not also be found in other **Winchest** lists from the **Top Eight**, but **DarkestHour's** is the only version to main deck a full set of **Statuary Maiden**.

<div class="pre-headline second">2nd place:</div>

### [trumpets' Deck][deck-2]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Winchest Midrange)

  [deck-2]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=CA4BCA3BDA8BEB4MEBIBBtIDBjMDBBGB-DDB5HECsHDDsIDDoICEzHEE2HEFkBEFmGEFwGEFyGEFvHEsfMEsfTCAABBvEBFtCBFuDBF1GBrfB&t=trumpets'%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Burning%20Hope%7D

{% card_image "Telut, Queen's Hand", "ci-small" %}

The absence of both **Vicious Highwayman** (4{% icon 'FFSS' %}) and also **Deepforged Plate** (5{% icon 'FFJJ' %}) means that **trumpets** can go lighter on {% icon 'F' %} sources. This frees up space for six **Justice Sigils**, providing plenty of extra fuel for **Telut, Queen's Hand** (7{% icon 'JJ' %}). While powerful on its own, **Telut's** ability adds yet another **Power** playing effect to enable **Martyr's Chains** (9{% icon 'JJJJ' %}) &mdash; potentially allowing **trumpets** to take out two enemy units in a single turn for free.

**Standout features:**{.highlight} With a total of 27 primary **Power** sources (**Sigils, Seats** and **Crests**) **trumpets'** is the only list in the **Top Eight** to include more than the minimum requirement of 25, and also the only deck that includes **Telut, Queen's Hand**.

<!-- 17F, 23J, 22S  -->

<div class="pre-headline third">3rd place:</div>

### [xSTEALTHx's Deck][deck-3]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Winchest Midrange)

  [deck-3]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=CA4BDA3BDA8BCB4MEBICBmFDBsFCBtIDBBDB-DCB5HECsHCDzIDDsIDDoIDEzHEE2HDFkBBFtCBF_CEFmGCFwGDFyGCFtHEFvHDpfPEsfTCAABBvEBB9JBBjMBF1GBrfB&t=xSTEALTHx's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Burning%20Hope%7D

{% card_image "Winchest Contraband", "ci-small" %}

By omitting **Martyr's Chains**, the 3rd Place list has a slightly lower curve than the frontrunners, topping out with **Xo of the Endless Hoard** (7{% icon 'FFF' %}). Perhaps accordingly, **xSTEALTHx** cuts back on **Power** drawing spells &mdash; totalling six instead of the expected eight. An even split between **Seek Power** and **Lost Scroll** (2{% icon 'JS' %}) is included, along with two more conditional sources in the form of **Winchest Cargo**/**Winchest Contraband**.

<!-- 18F. 20J, 20S - 2 Seek Power, 2 Winchest Cargo, 2 Lost scroll. No chains. -->

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} The only finishing list to include **Harsh Rule** (5{% icon 'JJ' %}) in the main deck, **xSTEALTHx** appropriately goes lighter on **Units** (21 total) and bigger on **Auric Runehammer** (4{% icon 'JJ' %}).

### [chriseay's Deck][deck-4]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Rakano Aggro)

  [deck-4]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EA4BEBNEBOCBXEBmEEBIEBiEEBrNEB6JEBpNEBBHB-DED-HEE5DCEBEF2CEF_CEFlGEFmGCAABBwBBBgEBBvEBB9JBEhD&t=chriseay's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Burning%20Hope%7D

{% card_image "Hojan, Crownbreaker", "ci-small" %}

Much lower to the ground than any of the other decks featured here, this list tops out at **3 Power** in the main deck, for **Whirling Duo** (3{% icon 'FJ' %}), **Red Canyon Smuggler** (3{% icon 'FJ' %}) and **Avigraft** (3{% icon 'JJ' %}). Meanwhile, more expensive cards are relegated to the **Black Market**, including a single **Deepforged Plate** (5{% icon 'FFJJ' %}) and one of **Obliterate** (5{% icon 'FF' %}). No less than seven **Justice Sigils** help to ensure that **Hojan, Crownbreaker's** (2{% icon 'JJ' %}) **Renown** ability reliably finds **Power** to draw without whiffing at any stage of the game. Even so, as a two-faction list with a low curve this deck has no trouble reaching its **Power** and **Influence** requirements. So it has room to include a pair of **Shugo Standards**, helping to advance the aggresive strategy.

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} This deck really wants to play **Units** on **Turns 1** and **2**, so **chriseay** has built in total of 15 **Undepleted Power** sources, including the conditional **Influence** source **Diplomatic Seal**.

<div class="pre-headline fifth">5th place:</div>

### [\_Kubi\_'s Deck][deck-5]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Winchest Midrange)

  [deck-5]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EA1BEF3GEDMEDlFEDBDF7GDDHEDqIBsfCEB6GGB7FDBBDBdEB4MEBFEE_FEE7FEBIEC6FCFkBCBjHCAABCnGBrfBBDnFBEjFBFtE&t=%C2%A0_Kubi_'s%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Burning%20Hope%7D

{% card_image "Combustion Cell", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 23F/22P  -->
**Fire** is slightly prioritized over **Primal** to help ensure that an early **Grenadin Drone** (1{% icon 'F' %}) can reliably be played on **Turn 1** going first, or a **Torch** (1{% icon 'F' %}) on the draw. As with the only other player piloting a **2 Faction** deck in the **Top Eight**, **\_Kubi\_** can expect to reach their **Influence** requirements quite comfortably on curve &mdash; in this case including even the steeper costs for **Xo of the Endless Hoard** (7{% icon 'FFF' %}) and **Molot & Nakova** (8{% icon 'FFFPPP' %}).  In a **2 Faction Fire** deck there is usually very little downside to including a full playset of **Granite Waystones** as **\_Kubi\_** does here. And in this case it makes even more sense, since combustible **Grenadin** are a central part of this deck's game plan.

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} In addition to the cards already mentioned, when you also account for **Kenna, Shaman of the Scale** (7{% icon 'PPP' %}), **\_Kubi\_'s** deck includes more triple-**Influence** cards than any other featured here, underscoring the upside to being in less than 3 factions.

### [Paradox's Deck][deck-6]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (FPS Scream/Haunted Highway)

  [deck-6]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBFEBICB6HBB7HDBlIDBrIEBhNEBjNEBlMDBoMEBpNDB2LDC6FEC7FDDzIEDBBDsIDDrICDqIEEiIEE5EEE5GCElICF6ECAABBoMBB2LBDzIBFzFBsfT&t=Paradox's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Burning%20Hope%7D

{% card_image "Granite Waystone", "ci-small" %}

Speaking of combustible **Grenadin**, disposable drones play a different but equally important role in this list. **Paradox** needs cheap **Combust** (1{% icon 'FS' %}) targets and also  backup **Units** for **Bandit Queen's** (4{% icon 'FFS' %}) charging **Quickdraw** attacks, so 4x **Granite Waystone** is a natural choice even though this **3-faction** list has more demanding **Influence** requirements. Fortunately **Diplomatic Seal** is included to help meet the demands, providing **Undepleted Power** and early color fixing.

<!-- 18F/15P/16S - Fire given silght preference for Bandit Queen, Granite Waystone provides 1/1s for Combust and Queen attacks. Diplo seals. -->

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} **Defiance** introduced a powerful new tool for this archetype in the form of **Secret Pasage** (1{% icon 'S' %}), but otherwise the list has changed very little with **Eternal's** newest expansion. **Paradox's** deck includes fewer **Set 5** cards than any other in the **Top 8** &dash; just **Secret Passage** and one copy of **Bloodlust** (6{% icon 'SS' %}) in the **Market**.

### [SunyVeil's Deck][deck-7]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Winchest Midrange)

  [deck-7]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EA8BEBIBBmFEB9EBBBHB-DBB5HDCsHEDsIEDoIEE0HEEzHEE2HEFkBEFmGEFwGEFyGEFtHEFvHEpfPCsfTCAABBvEBBjMBFuDBF1GBrfB&t=SunyVeil's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Burning%20Hope%7D

{% card_image "Bulletshaper", "ci-small" %}

**Justice** is heavily favored in this take on **Winchest** midrange, which by far includes more **Power** and **Influence** sources than any other to be found here. Seven **Justice Sigils** are waiting to be drawn by **Privilege of Rank** (2{% icon 'JJ' %}), going hand-in-hand with **Bulletshaper's**(2{% icon 'FJ' %}) discard ability. With help from this duo, **SunyVeil** can confidently run 4x **Winchest Cargo** in favor of **Seek Power**. While **Cargo's** **Transmute** effect may make it less consistent, the **Privilege/BulletShaper** package make up the difference, and the potential downside is offset by the opportunities created with **Winchest Contraband**.

<!-- 21F, 35J, 21S - Justice heavily favored, Martyr's Cross, Bulletshaper, Lost Scroll, Winchest Cargo, no seek Power, 8 Crests, Privilege of Rank. -->

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} In addition to the extra **Power** and **Influence** sources found here, every **Crest** available to the **Winchest** alliance is included &mdash; giving SunyVeil no less than 12 opportunites to **Scout** for the cards he needs.

### [Sannd's Deck][deck-8]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Winchest Midrange)

  [deck-8]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EA3BEA8BEBIDB3ECBmFBBvECBtIDBBDB-DDB5HECsHDDzIDDsICDoIDEzHEE2HEFkBEFmGEFyGEFtHEFvHDpfPEsfTCAABBsFBBrNBB9JBF1GBrfB&t=Sannd's%20Deck%20%7BECQ%20Burning%20Hope%7D

{% card_image "Regent's Tomb", "ci-small" %}

Taking a more **Unit**-based approach than any of the other **Winchest** decks seen here, this list goes lighter on **Power** draw spells to include role players such as **Valkyrie Enforcer** (2{% icon 'JJ' %}) and three of **Vicious Highwayman** (4{% icon 'FFSS' %}) in the main deck. Although **Xo of the Endless Hoard** (7{% icon 'FFF' %}) can still be found at the top end, the extra 3-drops lower **Sannd's** curve, as does the absence of **Martyr's Chains**.

<!-- Four Winchest Cargos but no Lost Scrolls. Curve tops out at 7 for Xo and no Martyr's Cross.  -->
**Standout feature:**{.highlight} The only **Winchest** deck in the **Top 8** to prioritize **Shadow** over the other two factions in the **Power** base, most likely to reliably play **Vicious Highwayman** when it counts.

The landscape for **Eternal** looks a lot different now that it did for **Burning Hope** following the most recent \*[balance changes](https://steamcommunity.com/games/531640/announcements/detail/1690440309949401220). It remains to be seen what new archetypes will emerge - or what older ones may resurface - in response to the update. However it seems likely that **Winchest** midrange will continue to be part of the mix even as it may become less dominant. {.subtitle}

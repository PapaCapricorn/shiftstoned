**{% date page.date %}** - The first [Eternal Chapionship Qualifier][] event of the 2020 season has concluded, with **Xenan Cultists** emerging victorious despite having a target painted on their backs. **Nahid's Faithful** and friends composed an overwhelming sixty percent of the field, with a proportionate share of the **Top 8**.

The remaining non-**Cultist** lists in the event appeared custom-built to counter this boogeyman of the format. However&mdash;while a single archetype was predominant&mdash;no two builds among the finishers were the same. Here we take a look at the construction of the winning decks, highlighting the shared traits and standout features of each.

### [BruisedByGod's Deck][deck-1]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Xenan Cultists)

  [deck-1]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EH5FEB_HEH6FEBlIEHpBDH7FEAjBEF9GDHuBEB4IEHwEEFgHEHyEFB5HIB_BEH5DEA9BEH4FCAABHiBBH7DBGpCBGwGBBzJ&t=%5BBruisedByGod%5D%20BruisedByGod's%20Deck

{% card_image "Swirl the Sands", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 16T, 21S, E-Makkar x4, Prohpet x4, V-favor x4, Ark of Sol [M]
-->

**Seek Power Gaming's BruisedByGod** returns in style to the competitive spotlight of **Eternal** following a hiatus. Like all of the Xenan Cultist decks seen here, **BBG's** first-place build features a full playset of **High Prophet of Sol** (2{% icon 'T' %}) along with an **Ark of Sol** (1{% icon 'T' %}) in the Market.

What distinguishes the **Power** sourcing in this list from the others is a full set of **Vara's Favor** (2{% icon 'S' %}). **BBG** also chooses to go with four of **Emblem of Makkar**, but forgoes **Emblem of Grodov** in favor of eight **Time Sigils**&mdash;more than any other deck seen here.

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} **BBG's** version of **Xenan Cultists** was the only one of the finishers to include a **Swirl the Sands** (3{% icon 'T' %}) in the **Market**, which proved to be relevant in at least on matchup during the semi-finals.

### [AntMan's Deck][deck-2]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Hooru Vanguard)

  [deck-2]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=CBiEEH_BBBhGDF1DEFxCEH_FEH1GEGpHEB6ECEtFBF_CBHrDEFlEEHsDEFiDBB8GDF-FFB-DKB7FCG7CEGoHEAzBCAABFvCBHkCBHnCBE-HBH7C&t=%5BAntMan%5D%20AntMan's%20Deck

{% card_image "Emerald Coin", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 15J, 18P: 2x Emerald Coin, Emblem-L [M]
**Shen-Ra, Unbreakable** (1J), -->

Perhaps the most innovative list among the finishers, **AntMan's Hooru** deck appears to be built specifically with the intention of putting **Xenan Cultists** in the crosshairs. Among other things, **Curse** based removal deftly dodges **Nahid's Choice**. The **Exalted / Renown / Weapon** synergies along with the inclusion of rarely seen **Units** such as **Jarral's Frostkin** (4{% icon 'P' %}) and **Imperial Loyalist** (4{% icon 'J' %}) make this deck particularly spicy.

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} The only deck here to feature **Coins** of any kind, in this case **Emerald Coins**. Although these **Power** sources come in **Delpleted**, having a couple of extra +1/+1 **Spiked Helms** around certainly makes up for it in a deck that wants to speed up the **Mastery** thresholds for **Varret, Hero-in-Training** (2) and **Blitrok, Linrei's Listener** (4{% icon 'PPP' %})&mdash;not to mention the **Weapon** synergies from **Units** such as **Axe Sharpener** (2{% icon 'J' %}) and **Imperial Loyalist** (4{% icon 'J' %}).

### [Thalian's Deck][deck-3]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Hooru Tempo)

  [deck-3]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EBgEEBiEEBhGEHjCEBrEDE-HEH_FEH1GEGpHEEtFBF_CEHsDEGmEHB-DFB7FDH9BEH7CEGoHEAzBCAABC5GBHkCBHyCBHhGBH6C&t=%5BThalian%5D%20Thalian's%20Deck

{% card_image "Ice Elemental", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 18J, 17P: -->

Fast **Hooru** builds have often been touted as an antidote to **Cultists** and that proved mostly true for **Thalian** with this list. Although the curve appears to jump from 4 to 7 **Power**, **Xulta Loyalist** (7{% icon 'JJ' %}) wants to be played for **3 Power** and **Shifted** - so realistically this deck plays low to the ground and tops out with **Daring Gryffyn** (4{% icon 'PP' %}).

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} A **Soulflame Rider**(9{% icon 'J' %}) in the **Market** may seem risky with exactly zero **Spells** or **Units** boasting the **Decimate** tag, but a total of seven **Emblems** ensure that the 9-cost **Paladin Gryffyn** can reliably be played for less than full price or even for free under the right circumstances.

### [camat0's Deck][deck-4]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Xenan Cultists)

  [deck-4]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EH5FEB_HEH6FEBlICEsGEHpBEH7FEF9GEHuBEB4IEHwEEFgHEHyEHB5HCB_BEHfEH5DEA9BEH4FCAABHiBBBgDBGwGBBgPBBzJ&t=%5Bcamat0%5D%20camat0%27s%20Deck

{% card_image "Fenris Nightshade", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 14T, 19S, E-Grodov x4, E-Makkar x4, Prophet x4, Ark of Sol [M]
-->

One of only two lists to include every available **Emblem**, **camat0's** deck is also the only **Xenan Cultist** build to feature **Fenris Nightshade** (2{% icon 'S' %}) for additional card draw. Three of the finsishers chose to include **Edict of Grodov** (3{% icon 'T' %})&mdash;a useful tool in the mirror match&mdash;but **Camat0's** list is the only one to include a full set.

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} When **Fenris** is not enough, this list looks for even more draws from a **Vault of the Praxis** (4{% icon 'TT' %}) in the **Market**, taking advantage of low cost units and tokens which may be played on in multiples on a single turn.

### [xSTEALTHx's Deck][deck-5]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Kerendon Control)

  [deck-5]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EB4MEEsGCFwGEGnDBAjBDB9CDHmGDF9GDFyGDBgDEHvEEHwEEHwFCBxDEHyECF2FDB-DFB5HDB_BEA9BEA6BEA3BCF2HCAABGwGBF1GBG1GBBzJBH5D&t=%5BxSTEALTHx%5D%20xSTEALTHx's%20Deck

{% card_image "Shen-Ra Speaks", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 20T, 22J, 25S: 4x Seek Power, 2x Lost Scroll, 1x Vara's Favor, 3x Amber Acolyte, Regent's Tomb, Emblem of Makkar -->

Attacking **Cultists** from a different direction, **xSTEALTHx's** deck plays many of the same **Shadow** threats that **Xenan** does&mdash;including **Incarnus**, **Karvet** and **Vara**&mdash;but hopes to outgrind two-color decks with access to powerful removal tools available only to **Justice**. **Shen-Ra Speaks** (5{% icon 'TTJJ' %}) is the **Expedition** format's most powerful sweeper, while **Cast Into Shadow** ({% icon 'JSS' %}) can also take out multiple targets at once.

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} The only three faction deck in the **Top 8**, **xSTEALTHx's** list appropriately includes more **Power** sources than any other&mdash;including four of **Seek Power** (1) and two **Lost Scrolls** (2{% icon 'JS' %})&mdash;to reliably play **Shen-Ra Speaks** on curve. The **Lingering Influence** (1{% icon 'J' %}) of **Rolant** surrounding the **Regent's Tomb** (4{% icon 'JS' %}) also helps **xSTEALTHx** to hit their **Power** and **Influence** targets.

### [Bardeane's Deck][deck-6]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Xenan Cultists)

  [deck-6]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EH5FEB_HEH6FEBlIEHpBEH7FDAjBEF9GDHuBEBgDEHwEEFgHEHyEFB5HEB_BEHfEH5DEA9BEH4FCAABHiBBH7DBHvEBGwGBBzJ&t=%5BBardeane%5D%20Bardeane's%20Deck

{% card_image "Edict of Makkar", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 16T, 20S, E-Grodov x4, E-Makkar x4, Prophet x4, V-favor x3, Ark of Sol [M] -->

One of two finsishers to include a full regiment of **Emblems** in both colors, **Bardeane**'s list is the only one to feature a full set of **Scorpion Wasps** (3{% icon 'T' %}) in the main deck.

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} More **Shadow** removal can be found in the Market&mdash;including both **Edict of Makkar** (1{% icon 'S' %}) and **Fell Ritual** (4{% icon 'SS' %}).

### [Sunyveil's Deck][deck-7]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Xenan Cultists)

  [deck-7]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=EH5FEB_HEH6FEBlIEHpBEH7FDALBAjBBAkBCHtBEF9GBBgDEB4ICHvEEHwEEFgHHB5HGB_BEH5DEA9BEH4FCAABHiBBH7DBHyEBBzJBHf&t=%5BSunyveil%5D%20Sunyveil's%20Deck

{% card_image "Talir's_Favored", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 17T, 20S, E-Makkar x4, Prophet x4, T-favor x3, V-favor x1, Ark of Sol [M] -->

**Sunyveil's** take on **Cultists** lowers the curve slightly by unexpectedly relegating **Shadow** powerhouse **Karvet, Solar Dragon** (6{% icon 'SS' %}) to the **Market** insted of the main deck.

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} The only list to feature **Talir's Favored** (2{% icon 'T' %}) for additional **Time** sources.

### [LimFactor's Deck][deck-8]{.epc-link target="_blank"} (Xenan Cultists)

  [deck-8]: https://www.shiftstoned.com/epc/?d=CH5FEB_HEH6FCBlIEHpBEH7FDAjBDHtBEF9GEBgDDE_GEHwEDFgHEHyECBzJKB5HHB_BEA9BEH4FCAABHiBBH7DBHvEBGwGBCnF&t=%5BLimFactor%5D%20LimFactor's%20Deck

{% card_image "Slimespitter Slug", "ci-small" %}

<!-- 15T, 21S, Prophet x4, V-favor x1, Ark of Sol [M] -->

In contrast, this **Cultist** build raises the curve&mdash;being the only one of the finishing lists to include **Vara, Fate-touched** (8{% icon 'SSS' %}) in the main deck. Accordingly **LimFactor** prioritizes **Shadow** over **Time** sources, with 10 **Shadow Sigils** in the **Power** base and three of **Vara's Favor** (2{% icon 'S' %}).

**Standout feature:**{.highlight} **Big Vara** in the main deck frees up room for **Slimespitter Slug** (6{% icon 'SS' %}), a powerful threat to enemy fliers as well as a source of life gain.

The Expedition format has changed with the recent introduction of cards from Dead Reckoning and Trials of Grodov. Will Cultists continue to dominate in the days ahed, or will a new challenger emerge?
